# Self-Healing Engine — LOCC

The self-healing engine performs **safe, rule-based remediation** in response to alerts generated by the LOCC alerting system.

It is designed to:
- Automatically recover from common, low-risk failures
- Avoid destructive actions
- Log all remediation steps
- Escalate to humans when recovery fails

Self-healing actions are strictly **alert-driven** and configurable via policy rules.
